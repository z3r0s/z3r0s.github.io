Over the summer, I decided to tackle the problems from a wargame that I have put off for a long time. 

I have been playing [pwnable.kr](pwnable.kr) on and off but it was not practical to solve all the challenges within my expected timeline.

So instead, I decided to tackle the challenges on [reversing.kr](reversing.kr). The challenges on the site were not pwnable but they were good exercise problems.  

After many days of struggling, I ended up solving all challenges :)

**Custom Shell** and **Adventure** were very interesting. I had to spend most time since I was not very familiar with them. I would not go into the details as it would not make it fun for others.  

If you are new to reverse engineering, these are great practice problems to hone your skills.
