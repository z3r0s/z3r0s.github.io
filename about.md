## Who am I?  

I am currently an android security analyst intern at [redacted] and I spend most of my time doing security reserarch on either android platform or the application. 
 
I enjoy finding flaws in the programs and I am particularly interested in mobile and automobile security. Whenever I have a free time, I play ctf as it is a great resource to strengthen my exploitation skills.
